# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the Rock Paper Scissors game with the consoler.
The project took me 3 days to finish.
The very first day making the project, I was stunned looking at the blank JS file without knowing to do anything. I have learned likely every concepts needed to make this project but somehow it was still very vague to me to apply them into the real project. 
Thus after creating a diagram and pseudocode, I started searching for instruction video on Youtube and try to follow him to code. Though, I did not attempt to code exactly the same to him, after watching his video,my knowledge about functions and JS concepts has been strengthened and I believe I can start working on this project by my own way of coding. And I have successfully finished it
